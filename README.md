In this project I analyzed a Human Resource dataset with information of employees who stayed and left an organization. The purpose of the analysis is to analyze the significant factors that drive employee turnover, by performing survival analysis, to then implement a Supervised Machine Learning classification model to predict whether an employee is going to quit, and analysis its main features to discussed how to improve the causes for quitting.

<b> Notable Skills </b>
- <font size ="-2">Data extraction and Transformation </font>
- <font size ="-2">Data analysis and Interpretation </font>
- <font size ="-2">SQL Efficiency </font>
- <font size ="-2">Problem Solving </font>

In this project, I studied the patterns of FitBit users during their product usage. I considered the number of steps as an estimator of their physical activity, and weight, BMI (Body Mass Index), and gender as estimator for their BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate). The goal was to determine if whether users achieved their weight loss goals, as well as suggestions to improve clients-product relationship.
